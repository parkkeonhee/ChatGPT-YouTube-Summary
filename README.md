# ChatGPT API: Summarize YouTube Videos by Reading Transcripts.

This Node.js application utilizes the OpenAI API to generate a summary of a YouTube video transcript. The process begins by fetching the transcript of a YouTube video. This transcript is then sent to the OpenAI GPT-3 model, which generates a summary that is subsequently printed to the console.

The GPT-3 model is prompted with the phrase "Provide summary of this video transcript: ", followed by the transcript itself. The model then generates a summary of the transcript.

The example provided uses the YouTube video ID of BlackPink's "Playing with Fire" song. This ID can be replaced with the ID of any YouTube video to generate a summary of that video's transcript.

Please note that you need to have the OpenAI API key and the `youtube-browser-api` module properly set up for this script to work.

## Setup.

1. Add your OpenAI API key to your `~/.zprofile`:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with the API key obtained from your OpenAI profile.

2. Install the necessary npm packages:
    npm i openai youtube-browser-api

3. Run the script:
    node plugin.js

## Example Output.

The output will be a summary of the YouTube video transcript, generated by the OpenAI GPT-3 model.

## Code Explanation.

1. `const Api = await import('youtube-browser-api');` - Imports the `youtube-browser-api` module for fetching the transcript of a YouTube video.

2. `const transcriptData = await Api.default.transcript({ videoId });` - Fetches the transcript of the YouTube video with the given video ID.

3. `const transcript = transcriptData.videoId.map(item => item.text).join(' ');` - Concatenates all the transcript text into a single string. The `map` function creates a new array containing just the `text` properties from each item in the `videoId` array. The `join` function concatenates all the items in this new array into a single string, with a space between each item.

4. `const provideSummary = "Provide summary of this video transcript: " + transcript;` - Creates a prompt for the OpenAI GPT-3 model. The prompt is "Provide summary of this video transcript: " followed by the transcript.

5. `const gptResponse = await openai.createCompletion({...});` - Sends the prompt to the OpenAI GPT-3 model and waits for the response. The `createCompletion` function generates a completion of the prompt.

6. `console.log(gptResponse.data.choices[0].text.trim());` - Prints the generated summary to the console. The `trim` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the summary.

7. `getVideoSummary('9pdj4iJD08s');` - Calls the `getVideoSummary` function with the YouTube video ID of BlackPink's "Playing with Fire" song as an example. You can replace `'9pdj4iJD08s'` with the ID of any YouTube video to generate a summary of that video's transcript.
